# Mammoth Blender Tools

Various tools for adding components to objects and exporting the result as Mammoth JSON

## Features

## Components

This addon adds a `Mammoth Components` section to each object. This section can be used to apply pre-defined components to objects in the scene which can be saved later:

The pre-defined components are given in a JSON file, according to this schema: [_(TODO)_](#).

### File Export

This addon includes a custom exporter for easy loading into the Mammoth framework, as schematized JSON file.

See the [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) for the Mammoth 3D files here: [mammoth.schema.json](schema/mammoth.schema.json)
